Instructions:

1. Open up the file "guessinggame"
2. Play the game!

Notes: 
1. You may have to double-click the atlas on some runs. It's a weird glitch that randomly happens with pygame that I could not figure out how to fix.
2. You may also have to right-click the executable file and press "open" to bypass the security features that block the opening of un-identified executables.
